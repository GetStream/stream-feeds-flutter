/// {@template stream_feeds_client}
/// Stream Feeds client for building scalable newsfeeds and activity streams.
///
/// The main entry point for integrating Stream's Feeds API into your Dart/Flutter
/// application that provides comprehensive tools for building activity feeds, social
/// interactions, real-time updates, rich queries, state management, moderation,
/// and multi-platform support.
///
/// ## Getting Started
///
/// Initialize the client with your API key and user information:
///
/// ```dart
/// final client = StreamFeedsClient(
///   apiKey: 'your-api-key',
///   user: User(
///     id: 'user-123',
///     name: 'John Doe',
///     imageUrl: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg',
///     customData: {'email': 'john@example.com'},
///   ),
///   userTokenProvider: UserTokenProvider.static('user-jwt-token-here'),
///   config: FeedsConfig(
///     // Optional configuration
///   ),
/// );
///
/// // Connect to start receiving real-time updates
/// await client.connect();
/// ```
///
/// ### Different User Types
///
/// The [User] class supports different authentication types:
///
/// ```dart
/// // Regular user with full details
/// final regularUser = User(
///   id: 'user-123',
///   name: 'John Doe',
///   imageUrl: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg',
///   role: 'admin',
///   customData: {'department': 'Engineering'},
/// );
///
/// // Guest user (temporary access)
/// final guestUser = User.guest('guest-456');
///
/// // Anonymous user (no authentication required)
/// final anonymousUser = User.anonymous();
/// ```
///
/// ## Token Management
///
/// The client uses a [TokenProvider] for flexible token management:
///
/// ```dart
/// // Static token (for development or long-lived tokens)
/// final staticProvider = UserTokenProvider.static('your-jwt-token');
///
/// // Dynamic token (for refreshable tokens or secure storage)
/// final dynamicProvider = UserTokenProvider.dynamic(() async {
///   // Fetch from secure storage, API, etc.
///   final token = await secureStorage.read(key: 'user_token');
///   if (token == null) {
///     throw Exception('No token available');
///   }
///   return token;
/// });
/// ```
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Activity Feeds**: Create and manage activity streams with real-time updates
/// - **Social Interactions**: Comments, reactions, follows, and bookmarks
/// - **Type-safe Queries**: Advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination
/// - **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live feed synchronization
/// - **Content Moderation**: Built-in moderation tools and configurations
/// - **Multi-platform**: Pure Dart implementation for all platforms
///
/// For more detailed documentation and examples, visit:
/// https://getstream.io/docs/feeds/
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract interface class StreamFeedsClient {

  ///
  /// final client = StreamFeedsClient(
  ///   apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
  ///   user: user,
  ///   userTokenProvider: UserTokenProvider.static(token),
