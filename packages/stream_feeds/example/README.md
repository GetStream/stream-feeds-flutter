# Stream Feeds Example

This is a very basic example of how to use the Stream Feeds SDK.
For a more complete example, you can check the [Stream Feeds sample app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-feeds-flutter/tree/main/sample_app).

## Getting Started

To run the example, you need to get your own credentials from Stream and update the `lib/main.dart` file.
For more detailed documentation and examples, visit:
[https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/flutter/](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/flutter/)

Then, you can run the example using the following command:

```bash
flutter create .
flutter run -d chrome
```

For some platforms, such as macOS, you may need to add internet permissions to the app.
